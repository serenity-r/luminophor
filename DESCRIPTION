Description: HTMLWidget implementation of Lumino
    Lumino, previously known as PhosphorJS, provides a rich set of widgets, 
    layouts, events, and data structures. These enable developers to construct 
    advanced, production-quality, desktop-like web applications that would be 
    otherwise impossible using CSS alone. See the Lumino library
    (https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino) and PhosphorJS documentation
    (https://phosphorjs.github.io/) for more information.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.0)
