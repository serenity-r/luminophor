\title{Create a LuminophoR dock htmlwidget}
\usage{
luminophor(items = NULL, width = "100\%", height = "72vh", elementId = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{items}{Options for htmlwidget (currently not used in this function)}

\item{width, height}{Fixed width/height for widget (in css units). The default
is NULL, which results in intelligent automatic sizing based on the widget's
container. (currently not used in this function - see
\code{\link{luminophorOutput}} to set size specifications)}

\item{elementId}{Use an explicit element ID for the widget (rather than an
automatically generated one). Useful if you have other JavaScript that
needs to explicitly discover and interact with a specific widget instance.}
}
\description{
This function creates a LuminophoR dock using htmlwidgets. The widget can be
rendered on HTML pages generated from R Markdown, Shiny, or other applications.
